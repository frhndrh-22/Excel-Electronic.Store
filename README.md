## Excel-Electronic.Store #

Welcome to the Excel-Electronic.Store project! In this repository, I've demonstrated my skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Excel to analyze sales data for an electronic store. This project showcases my ability to handle large datasets, apply Excel functions, and present insights that are crucial for business decision-making.

## 📝 Project Overview 📅 ##

The dataset consists of sales transactions from an electronic store. It includes information on products, prices, quantities, order dates, cities, and purchase addresses. Through this analysis, I aimed to:
Clean and structure the data for analysis.
Perform descriptive analysis (e.g., total sales, sales by product, sales by city).
Create pivot tables to summarize sales trends.
Visualize the data through charts to make it easier to interpret.
